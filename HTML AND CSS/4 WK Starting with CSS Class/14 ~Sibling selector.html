      The general sibling combinator (~) separates two selectors and matches all
      iterations of the second element, that are following the first element
      (though not necessarily immediately), and are children of the same parent
      element.

    <article>
      <span>This is not red because it appears before any paragraph.</span>
      <p>Here is a paragraph.</p>
      <code>Here is some code.</code>
      <span>
        This span is red because it appears after the paragraph, even though
        there are other nodes in between

        Doesn't matter how many or what kind of nodes are in between, all spans
        from the same parent after a paragraph are red.

    </article>

    <span>
      This span is not red because it it doesn't share a parent with a paragraph
